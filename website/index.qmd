## Background of this project

In this project we examine two major questions.

[**1. How do economic periods, as measured by GDP, affect art themes in America?**]{.underline}

Our question stems from historical patterns, where economic booms—like the Dutch Golden Age, the Renaissance, and the Roman Empire—not only sparked growth but also led to a surge in art, often focused on prosperity or mythology. 

Since GDP data is available from the 20th century, we focused on the U.S., which experienced major booms and recessions, such as the post-WW2 expansion and the Great Depression.

[**2. Is there a relationship between social movements, like Black Lives Matter and GDP?**]{.underline}

This question stems from an interest in how America's economic conditions impact the popularity of key social movements. 

For example, during the 2008 Great Recession, economic justice movements like Occupy Wall Street gained prominence, while in more stable times, movements tended to focus on civil rights and gender equality. 

## Our aims for this project

Historically, art has tended to flourish in times of economic prosperity, while during periods of economic hardship, art themes tend to shift. By tracking GDP over the past century, we hope to identify these economic shifts and see if they align with changes in the art themes that are popular during those times. As students familiar with social media, we also thought it would be interesting to see how recent social movements are impacted by GDP.
