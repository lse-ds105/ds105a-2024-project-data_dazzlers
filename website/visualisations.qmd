### Reasoning behind choice of visualisation

-   Since we chose a big amount of art themes to look at, we wanted to show correlation, but we did not want any conclusion from the graph to be confusing or misinterpreted.

-   Therefore we chose to make an interactive graph where you can choose to look at all the art themes together, the average effect of GDP on art themes produced or the effect of GDP on any of the art themes.

-   We also chose to have medium to dark colours for the lines to ensure visibility and clarity for everyone. 

### Our insights

:::  {.callout .callout-note}
1.  There’s quite a clear trend for this graph as every theme shows the same relationship. There’s an immediate peak when the GDP is \$1191 billion (as you can see my hovering above the peak point) and then there’s a stark decrease.

2.  Furthermore, for some art themes such as portraits, there’s an occasional local maximum when the GDP is at \$8374 billion. From the graph alone it seems that the optimum GDP for any art theme production is \$1191 billion.  
:::

3.  However, it is also important to notice that the highest number of paintings occurs in the 1920s (with a GDP value of \$1191 billion) while the GDP value of \$1089 occurs in the 1930s. The rest of the GDP values occur in chronological order (from 1940s on). Therefore, it appears that all art themes are less produced as time goes on. While there’s seems to be a nice correlation between GDP and art themes, it is not possible to tell whether this correlation can be attributed to causation without further research.

4.  It should also be considered, that the low number of paintings for each theme after the peak could be because other art forms such as digital art have become more popular. This would limit the number of modern artwork that the Smithsonian database has.

## 2. Heatmap: Creation of art themes & GDP

### Reasoning behind choice of visualisation

-   We choose to represent our data using a heatmap as it was the most efficient way to show all the data about all the decades and the top 20 art themes at once.

-   A heatmap allows us to compare multiple decades and themes.

-   A heatmap means that any patterns and trends are clearly highlighted. 

For our heatmap, we chose to look at each decade. We focused on the proportion of artworks that had the top 20 art themes for each decade.

. Overall, when the GDP is lower, the ratio of art themes produced tends to be more spread out, with similar ratios for all the art pieces.

### Our insights

::: {.callout .callout-note}
1.  For the heatmap, there were no clear trends that could be identified between GDP and art themes. But as GDP increases, the spread themes artworks are created in becomes less consistent.
:::

::: {.callout .callout-note}
2.  There were some themes like architecture, "Figure group" and "Landscape" that tended to have a similar ratio regardless of the GDP. Other themes varied a lot with high ratios in certain years with certain GDP but had occasionally had low values with other GDPs, for example the art theme "Religion" had a high ratio of 50% but had a majority of 0% values.

3.  Overall, when the GDP is lower, the ratio of art themes produced tends to be more spread out, with similar ratios for all the art pieces.
:::

::: {.callout .callout-note}
4.  The 2010s show an exclusive focus on "Portraits" and "Religion," while other themes disappear entirely. This may suggests a narrowing artistic interest, **however** this trend is more likely due to less modern artwork being in the Smithsonian Museum which may have skewed results.
