By tracking GDP over the past century, we hope to identify these economic shifts and see if they align with changes in the art themes that are popular during those times. As students who are very familiar with social media, we also thought it would be interesting to see how recent social movements are impacted by GDP.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n<img src=\"./images/homepage.png\" alt=\"Exploring the realationship between art themes, social movements and the economy!\"/>\n\n## Background of this project\n\nIn this project we examine two major questions.\n\n[**1.
