    "text": "Background of this project\nIn this project we examine two major questions.\n1. How do economic periods, as measured by GDP, affect art themes in America?\nOur question stems from historical patterns, where economic booms—like the Dutch Golden Age, the Renaissance, and the Roman Empire—not only sparked growth but also led to a surge in art, often focused on prosperity or mythology. \nSince GDP data is available from the 20th century, we focused on the U.S., which experienced major booms and recessions, such as the post-WW2 expansion and the Great Depression.\n2. Is there a relationship between social movements, like Black Lives Matter and GDP?\nThis question stems from an interest in how the economic conditions of America impact some key social movements. Furthermore, as students who are familiar with social media, we thought it would be interesting to see how GDP impacts recent social movements.\nFor example, during the 2008 Great Recession, economic justice movements like Occupy Wall Street gained prominence, while in more stable times, movements tend to focus on civil rights and gender equality."

    "text": "Our motivations for this project\nHistorically, art has tended to flourish in times of economic prosperity, while during periods of economic hardship, art themes tend to shift. By tracking GDP over the past century, we hope to identify these economic shifts and see if they align with changes in the art themes that are popular during those times. As students who are very familiar with social media, we also thought it would be interesting to see how recent social movements are impacted by GDP."

    "text": "Initially our hypothesis was that there was a positive correlation between art themes and GDP. This hypothesis was based on historical examples of this relationship, such as the Dutch Golden Age in the 17th century where GDP boomed but art production also greatly increased and the popularity of certain art themes, such as marine painting,architectural painting, and flower still lifes, also rose [1].\nHowever, we instead found the opposite happened! It appears that as GDP rose the number of artworks actually decreased. This could be because other forms of art such as digital art, animation and music become more mainstream as GDP increases.\nWe also thought that economic prosperity drives art with celebratory themes, while downturns encourage more somber, socially reflective works.\nIn regards to art themes, we did not find any clear trends that linked art themes and GDP. This generally suggests that art is not always such a direct reflection of the economic prosperity of America, there are likely other factors such as cultural or political shifts that have a greater impact on art themes.\n\n\n\nInitally we hypothesised that during economic prosperity, social media would serve as a new platform for expression, while in times of economic distress (low GDP growth rates), both art and social media would reflect darker themes.\nOur main conclusion is that public sentiment on social movements has largely declined over time, even as GDP has increased. 2020–2023 continue to show mostly negative sentiment despite economic recovery after COVID 19, which may suggest that shifts in public sentiment towards social movements may not just be a short-term trend caused by the socio-eeconomic shock of COVID 19.\nAnother key conclusion is how the popularity of social movements appears to be impacted much more by external factors compared to GDP. This is especially the case for the BLM and Me Too movements. A rise in GDP may provide more media space for activism, but movements do not necessarily grow in direct proportion to GDP."
