# ðŸŽ¨ Exploring the Relationship Between Economic Periods, Social Movements, and Art Themes in America

1.  How do economic periods, as measured by GDP, affect art themes in America?
2.  Is there a relationship between social movements, like Black Lives Matter and GDP?

## Description of this repository:

1.  **What you will find here:**

    -   Separate notebooks within the `code` folder that collect data for each of the 3 APIs
    - Separate notebooks within the `code/Visualisations` folder that have trials of different visualisations, before we settled on the final 5
    - A `data` folder that contains raw and processed data 
    - The `website` and `docs` folder contain the markdown, html and images used to produce our website 

2.  **What we initially wanted to discover:**
We wanted to explore how changes in GDP might influence art and social movements. Drawing from historical examples like the Dutch Golden Age and the Renaissance, we hypothesized that economic booms would drive art that celebrates prosperity, while downturns would lead to darker, more somber themes. Focusing on the U.S., we aimed to see if the economic boom after WWI and the Great Depression had a similar effect on art.

We also wondered how GDP impacted social movements. Would movements like MeToo or Black Lives Matter have positive associations during prosperous times and more negative tones during economic hardship.


3.  **How we used AI**

## All API Credentials Setup

This explains how to obtain all API credentials and securely set them up for use.

### 1. Smithsonian:
-   To obtain a Smithsonian API key, you must create an account with [Smithsonian API Website](https://api.data.gov/signup/)

### 2. FRED:

-   FRED API creditials can be obtained by creating an account with the [FRED API website](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/login/secure/).

-   You then create an application and are given an API key

### 3. GDELT:
-   GDELT data is accessible to the public and does not require an API key

## How to run the code

### Step 1 - Clone the project repository

```         
bash     
git clone <git@github.com:lse-ds105/ds105a-2024-project-data_dazzlers.git>
```

```         

cd <ds105a-2024-project-data_dazzlers>
```

### Step 2 - Creating a virtual environment

**1. If you already have conda installed:**

You can create a new environment with the following command:

```         
bash
conda create -n .venv
```

Then, activate the environment:

``` bash
conda activate .venv
```

Install `pip` inside conda:

``` bash
conda install pip
```

**2. If you don't have conda installed**

Then on the command line run these commands

```         
cd /path/to/ds105a-2024-project-data_dazzlers
python -m venv .venv
```

If on Windows, run:

```         
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

If on MacOS or Linux, run:

```         
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```         
    bash     
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

**To deactivate the virtual environment:** `bash     pyenv deactivate`

### Step 3 - Order to run code in

``` bash
python helper_functions.py
```

This will run the functions stored.

If you're working with Jupyter notebooks, you can start the notebook server with:

``` bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then, navigate to the relevant notebook file and run the cells to replicate the analysis interactively.

We recommend running the code in this order:

1.  Run ... to collect and process the data
2.  Run ... for data visualisations
