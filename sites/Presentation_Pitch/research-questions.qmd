# Research Questions

## 1. How does economic periods (measured through GDP) affect art themes in America? 
  a. Historically, the countries that have tended to be richer have also made more artworks (such as the roman empire and Greek empire making lots of statues and artworks throughout their more successful periods). Therefore, we wondered whether there was any correlation between the art themes present in a certain country and the economic well being of that country. We chose America because it is the hub of economic activity and therefore if might be interesting to see if it has a strong correlation between popular art themes. 
## 2. How do social movements affect recent art themes in America? 

We chose this to get a broader perspective on what affects art themes in America and build on our findings from question 1.
