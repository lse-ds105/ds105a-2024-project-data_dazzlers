## Risks: 
1. Technical Issues 
API Rate Limits: 
Exceeding request limits for FRED (120/min), Reddit (60/min), or Smithsonian API (unspecified but potential throttling). 
Downtime or Changes in API: 
Unexpected downtime, deprecation of endpoints, or changes to API functionality. 
Data Overload: 
Large datasets from Smithsonian or Reddit can slow processing and overwhelm storage or computational resources. 
2. Data Quality Issues 
Incomplete Data: 
FRED may lack microeconomic context or metadata for deeper interpretations. 
Smithsonian entries might miss detailed thematic tags for all artworks. 
Noisy Data: 
Reddit content can include spam, irrelevant posts, or off-topic discussions. 
Bias or Gaps: 
Data might reflect institutional or user biases (e.g., underrepresentation of certain themes in Smithsonian collections or Reddit). 
3. Analytical Risks 
Theme Attribution: 
Assigning art themes to economic or social periods is inherently interpretive and may lead to subjective conclusions. 
Correlations vs. Causations: 
Economic periods and social movements’ impacts on art are complex and multifactorial, risking oversimplified conclusions. 
4. Ethical and Legal Risks 
Data Privacy: 
Scraping Reddit user data must comply with ethical guidelines and Reddit’s terms of service. 
Copyright Concerns: 
Using Smithsonian media may require adherence to usage rights. 
 
## Backup plan: 
1. For Technical Issues 
Redundancy in APIs: 
Use alternate APIs if one fails: 
For economic data: World Bank API or OECD API. 
For art metadata: Europeana API or other open-access museum APIs. 
For social sentiment: Twitter API as an alternative to Reddit. 
Rate-Limiting Solutions: 
Implement request queuing and caching to stay within rate limits. 
Utilize API-provided bulk download options, like Smithsonian's collections dump. 
Use time.sleep() to limit the requests 
Local Backup: 
Download and store datasets locally for continued analysis if APIs become inaccessible. 
2. For Data Quality Issues 
Preprocessing Pipelines: 
Develop robust data cleaning processes: 
NLP models for Reddit (e.g., spam detection and topic modeling). 
Validation scripts for metadata completeness in Smithsonian datasets. 
Other Sources: 
Use academic and institutional reports or curated datasets for missing thematic data or validation. 
3. For Analytical Risks 
Iterative Analysis: 
Use peer reviews to validate findings. 
Transparent Reporting: 
Clearly state assumptions, limitations, and potential biases in the project's findings. 
4. For Ethical and Legal Risks 
Compliance with Terms: 
Review and strictly adhere to API terms of service and usage policies. 
Data Privacy Safeguards: 
Anonymize Reddit user data and focus on aggregated insights.
