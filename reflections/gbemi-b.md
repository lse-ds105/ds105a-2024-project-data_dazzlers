# Gbemi's Reflections

## Technical Contributions

-   I collected and processed the GDP data from 1929-2023 to be used in the data visualisations, as seen in [this](https://github.com/lse-ds105/ds105a-2024-project-data_dazzlers/commit/2b7d65f0fef0fef7348389481766b7390f2a6bed) commit link

-   I also contributed to the cleaning of the GDELT data, as seen in [this](https://github.com/lse-ds105/ds105a-2024-project-data_dazzlers/commit/994270ae1d75c49d380aff49bac9fea7a2080472) commit link

-   I organised our respository by putting all the different folders into the overarching code, data, docs and website folder. I also changed the output directories for any of the code to update the new repository structure, as seen in [here](https://github.com/lse-ds105/ds105a-2024-project-data_dazzlers/commit/456afa3f5522438460f3196977d5888abe3e66ae) and [here](https://github.com/lse-ds105/ds105a-2024-project-data_dazzlers/commit/dceecc2cc317b5d4ecb069cf294d140b22a0a6b0)

-   I created a requirements.txt file so that our virtual environment can be set up and editted the readme.md file as seen in [this](https://github.com/lse-ds105/ds105a-2024-project-data_dazzlers/commit/791828f45efe34b1ee92c6acc5b7d4b79f21d4b5) commit link

-   I created the website and integrated the theme, data visualisations and analysis. I created the images used and directed the general theme of the website.This required me to change some of the font sizes, plot sizes and plot backgrounds of the data visualisations, as seen [here](https://github.com/lse-ds105/ds105a-2024-project-data_dazzlers/commit/f54fed073f50cbaa9033cc3a49209d5f9b8d9f28) and [here](https://github.com/lse-ds105/ds105a-2024-project-data_dazzlers/commit/049a642bc6faabd6d2e36bdc0932abadb464a474).

## Team Collaboration

-   At the beginning of the project, after I had finished collecting my part of the data I helped my team mate to clean some parts of the GDELT data. This is evidenced in the above section

-   I created and shared a Word Document for my team mates to note down anything they would like to have included in the website

-   I helped to write out some of the data analysis and insights from the graph in collaboration with my team mate

-   I helped my team mate to think of ideas for data visualisation, to make our graphs more insightful and interesting

-   I made to do lists and contributed to the project board for our project as seen [here](https://github.com/lse-ds105/ds105a-2024-project-data_dazzlers/commit/90d049d569f39b2dd31373cbf3e9b923d59e3177)

-   Attempted to help gather more recent data for art themes as seen by the folder names gbemi [here](https://github.com/lse-ds105/ds105a-2024-project-data_dazzlers/commit/83e0302a4194196b04872a0049a9647d6aad87bf)

## Learning Journey

-   Before taking DS105A I did not know how to make websites at all, however through this group project I have learnt how to make website with Quarto. I have also discovered that I enjoy doing so!

-   A challenge I had to overcome was figuring out how to integrate the images from the data visualisation into the website despite the different backgrounds. I was able to do this through making the data visualisation backgrounds transparent and adding a content box.

-   Some areas for growth would be:

    -   Adding specific dates to tasks to improve clarity of work distribution

    -   Learning how to gather large amounts of data, as this is something that was challenging to do when I tried to gather more recent art themes data
