## **Technical Contributions**  

- I pulled data from the Smithsonian and GDELT API's, shown in (GDELT_Data)[../code/GDELT_Data] and (Smithsonian_data)[../code/Smithsonian_Data].  
- I transformed the Smithsonian "ProductionDate" column to "Date" and cleaned decade-based date formats to make them compatible with the other datasets.  
- I tried to create visualisations comparing art themes and social movement data, using SQLite to query.
- I processed all the data into dataframes using SQLite, as seen in (NB02)[../code/GDELT_Data/NB02_data_processing.ipynb].  
- I ensured that data outputs were structured efficiently for integration into the website.
- I wrote the README.md outline to explain how to run our project.

## **Team Collaboration**  

- At the beginning of the project, I collaborated with my teammates to clean the GDELT dataset, troubleshooting inconsistencies together and sharing solutions.  
- I supported the group by testing and reviewing data visualizations to ensure consistency with project goals and usability on the website.   
- I assisted in preparing a presentation outline and key insights to share our findings more cohesively.  
- I contributed suggestions for organizing the repository to ensure clean folder structures for better project management and easier collaboration.

## **Learning Journey**  

- Before this project, I had limited experience querying databases for large-scale social and cultural datasets. Through this group work, I have developed strong SQL querying skills, including strategies for combining multiple datasets.  
- I have significantly improved my ability to process complex datasets for effective visual analysis, particularly in contexts where information is sparse or incomplete.  
- One challenge I faced was finding an appropriate API to pull social movement data from. I overcame this through researching and trialing individual API's, including Reddit and Open Sanctions  
- I developed stronger problem-solving skills in reconciling data sources with different date formats and structures to achieve coherent outputs.  

### **Areas for Growth**  

- Enhancing skills in data collection to better gather large-scale, relevant datasets. This is because it took me many trys to get datasets  with the relevant information we needed. 
- Improving task organization by setting clearer timelines and more structured checkpoints for visual analysis and SQL tasks. 
- Gaining a deeper understanding of website integration processes to better support the team's final presentation outputs.
