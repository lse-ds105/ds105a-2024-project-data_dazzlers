                        "content": "\"Malvin Gray Johnson, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, and Max Weber were three New York City artists whose work was popularly assigned to the category of \"racial art\" in the interwar years of the twentieth century. The term was widely used by critics and the public at the time, and was an unexamined, unquestioned category for the work of non-whites (such as Johnson, an African American), non-Westerners (such as Kuniyoshi, a Japanese-born American), and ethnicized non-Christians (such as Weber, a Russian-born Jewish American). The discourse on racial art is a troubling chapter in the history of early American modernism that has not, until now, been sufficiently documented. Jacqueline Francis juxtaposes the work of these three artists in order to consider their understanding of the category and their stylistic responses to the expectations created by it, in the process revealing much about the nature of modernist art practices. Most American audiences in the interwar period disapproved of figural abstraction and held modernist painting in contempt, yet the critics who first expressed appreciation for Johnson, Kuniyoshi, and Weber praised their bright palettes and energetic pictures--and expected to find the residue of the minority artist's heritage in the work itself. Francis explores the flowering of racial art rhetoric in criticism and history published in the 1920s and 1930s, and analyzes its underlying presence in contemporary discussions of artists of color. Making Race is a history of a past phenomenon which has ramifications for the present. Jacqueline Francis is a senior lecturer at the California College of the Arts\"--Provided by publisher."

Since the beginning of her career she has rooted her abstract painting in subjective experience and brought a feminist perspective to what is perhaps the defining category of modern and contemporary art, breaking down preconceived notions of scale, technical achievement, and formal progress. Weatherford accents the surface of her recent luminous paintings and installations with neon lighting fixtures to evoke the dynamic nature of city life. This beautifully illustrated book presents all of Weatherford's neon works to date, along with essays by Robert Faggen, Katy Siegel, Jennifer Peterson, and an interview with the artist. Publisher"

Born in England, Cole emigrated in 1818 to the United States, where he transformed British and continental European traditions to create a distinctive American idiom. He embraced the picturesque, which emphasized touristic pleasures, and the sublime, an aesthetic category rooted in notions of fear and danger. Including striking paintings and a broad range of works on paper, from watercolors to etchings, mezzotints, aquatints, engravings, and lithographs, this book explores the trans-Atlantic context for Cole's oeuvre. These works chart a history of landscape aesthetics and demonstrate the essential role of prints as agents of artistic transmission. The authors offer new interpretations of work by Cole and the British artists who influenced him, including J.M.W. Turner and John Constable, revealing Cole's debt to artistic traditions as he formulated a profound new category in art. the American sublime."

                        "content": "During the period of 1967 to 1980 the Native American artist Fritz Scholder developed a body of work that explored aspects of Indian identity and experience in America. This paper examines the critical eye Scholder turned toward dominant understandings of the American Indian and the methods he used to challenge those assumptions. By framing this subject in a postcolonial discourse, this paper links Scholder's work to a larger context of decolonization found within the Native American community during the 1960s and 1970s. In order to better understand the critical position that Fritz Scholder took, I contrast his work with earlier constructs of Indian images and identities. This includes a discussion of the archetypes of noble and ignoble savages and White artists that employed those types to promote limiting understandings of Native Americans. I also evaluate the effects of colonial influence on Indian artists, how White art and educational institutions promoted a relatively narrow understanding of Indian painting, and how Indian artists would eventually come to challenge the establishment. This paper then examines two distinct categories of works within Scholder's Indian Series, paintings reflecting on Indian identity and paintings on Indian experience. I argue that his paintings on Indian identity serve to challenge dominant understandings of what it means to be Indian and attempt to navigate the challenges of constructing a new modern Indian identity. Scholder's paintings on Indian experience, on the other hand, address historic and contemporary issues that trouble the Indian community, confronting the dominant culture for its complicity in those problems. The paper concludes with a discussion of the state of Indian art in the wake of Fritz Scholder's Indian Series. I contend that the changing nature of Indian politics within the country changed priorities among Indian artists. I compare the works of a couple of Indian artists working since Scholder's completed his seminal series to illustrate this changing focus. I also highlight some of the new avenues of inquiry in the field of Indian art that opened up due to the new social and political environment of the 1980s and 1990s."

Her prestigious career spans seven decades and encompasses the diverse artistic media of painting, sculpture, performance, film and video. Carolee Schneemann is one of the most important artists of the post-war period. Her work in a range of media--painting, film and video, dance and performance, constructions and installations, the written word and the assemblage--presents an unparalleled catalogue of radical aesthetic experimentation. Meat Joy, 1964, Fuses, 1964-1966, Up to and Including Her Limits, 1973-1976, and Interior Scroll, 1975, are now considered canonical projects and required entries in any meaningful account of contemporary art, belying their previous infamy as feminist challenges to the very concept of an art historical canon. Throughout the last 50 years, Schneemann has participated in the most significant formulations of the avant-garde, having made crucial contributions in Fluxus, happenings, expanded cinema and performance cultures, while complicating generic definitions that might cohere to her work. Schneemann has been the subject of numerous exhibitions and publications throughout her career, and her work is in the collections of Tate Modern, Comune di Milano, Centre Georges Pompidou, Muzeum Wspo\u0301\u0142czesne Wroc\u0142aw, Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art. Carolee Schneemann: Unforgivable is the most thorough visual overview of Schneemann's work to date. Organised into five interrelated categories--Interviews and Correspondence, Painting, Cinema, Sites and Technological Processes--this volume brings together previously published essays and interviews by authorities on the artist's work. The texts, many scarce or out of print, examine the significance of Schneemann's work in its historical context, and its vital urgency for our present.\" -- Provided by publisher"

                        "content": "An epistolary history of postwar American art through the weird and wonderful mind of Peter Saul. Painter Peter Saul (born 1934), considered one of the founding fathers of pop art but certainly not reducible to that movement, is best known for his cartoonish paintings in Day-Glo hues satirizing American culture. Saul was born and raised in Northern California, attended Washington University, lived in Europe from 1956 to 1964, and then settled in Marin County from 1964 to 1976, where he found a community and began to make his reputation. The story of Saul's development in these crucial years is narrated by the artist himself in Peter Saul : Professional Artist Correspondence, 1945-1976. The letters in this volume, first to Saul's parents and then to his dealer, Allan Frumkin, are intimate and wide-ranging, full of the same kind of observations that make Saul's work so compelling. Throughout this period Saul was concerned not only with making his work but also making his life as an artist. The book is therefore very much the story of an artist finding his voice and then attempting to understand and participate in \"the art world\", as Saul worked first through pop, then \"funk\", and then essentially created his own category. Taken together, the letters in this book form not just an autobiography of the artist, but a memoir of American art history at a critical moment"

The exhibition aligns work by such diverse artists as Charles Sheeler, Christina Ramberg, and Matt Mullican with both historic folk art and works by self-taught artists ranging from Horace Pippin to Janet Sobel and Joseph Yoakum. It also examines a recent influx of radically expressive work made on the margins that redefined the boundaries of the mainstream art world, while challenging the very categories of \"outsider\" and \"self-taught.\" Historicizing the shifting identity and role of this distinctly American version of modernism's \"other,\" the exhibition probes assumptions about creativity, artistic practice, and the role of the artist in contemporary culture. The exhibition is curated by Lynne Cooke, senior curator, special projects in modern art, National Gallery of Art.--Provided by publisher."

Morris Graves: Selected Letters draws on a vast cache of the his unpublished correspondence, dating from his teenage years until his death in 2001. Few visual artists of any era have left such a rich and wide-ranging collections of letters, which makes this body of work an unusual and valuable document in American art. The Graves correspondence is remarkable for its scope, variety, and depth. Written to many correspondents over long periods of time, the letters include the artist's reflections on his art, the art world, philosophy (Zen Buddhism and Vedanta in particular), architecture (Graves designed his homes and gardens), and relationships with family, friends, and lovers. Graves himself preserved most of the letters, or copies of them, and put no restrictions on their use. Other letters come from a wide range of private and institutional sources. Among the correspondents are Graves's family; Marian Willard, his art dealer; Richard Svare, his companion in the 1950s; and Nancy Wilson Ross, novelist and Buddhist scholar. Other notable figures with whom Graves corresponded are poet Carolyn Kizer, art critic Theodore Wolff, curator Peter Selz, choreographer Merce Cunningham (for whom Graves created a set design), and painter Mark Tobey. Recurrent themes in the Graves letters are the tensions between sociability and solitude; the desire to be free of the material world versus the need for material comfort; the dismissal of commerce and the desperate need for money; the pleasures and pitfalls of love; and the difficulties of the creative life. The letters are organized topically under the broad categories of people (family, friends, intimates), places (homes and travels), and art (finances and philosophy).Independent curator Vicki Halper knew Graves toward the end of his life through her work as a modern art curator at the Seattle Art Museum. Lawrence Fong is the curator of American and regional art at the University of Oregon's Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art. \"A lively, valuable first-person resource by one of the region's most acclaimed artists. This collection of letters is refreshing for the fuller picture it provides of Graves's thoughts and actions. The notes identifying people and places in the correspondence are beautifully distilled, providing just enough to locate the letters without distracting from them.\" -Barbara Johns, author of Paul Horiuchi: East and West and Signs of Home: The Paintings and Wartime Diary of Kamekichi Tokita\"This book is the essence of the rare written work of one of the most interesting artists of twentieth-century America. He is not only one of the essential figures in the American Northwest but also one of the leading artists between the Asian and western world.\" -Wulf Herzogenrath, Director, Kunsthalle Bremen\"-- Provided by publisher."

Barnard English professor Miller surveys the history of sartorial style and flamboyance among black dandies and the cultural responses, both fascinated and alarmed, they have provoked. She paints a broad and teeming panorama: the 18th-century English dandy whose stylishness subtly subverted the markers of slavery; his appearance in the writings of Harriet Beecher Stowe, Mark Twain and W.E.B. Du Bois; his reappearance in 20th-century Harlem as an icon of freedom and modernity; his role in avant-garde film and art; and modern-day avatars Sean Combs and Andre 3000. Throughout, she explores the protean manifestations of dandyism, its blurring of racial and sexual boundaries, its significations of status and respectability, its capacity to satirize white fashionableness even as it expressed black determination to emulate and surpass white high-style. Miller's writing can be densely academic\"A dandy is a kind of embodied, animated sign system that deconstructs given and normative categories of identity\"but she offers an incisive, nuanced analysis of a rich vein of cultural history.

                        "content": "\"A comprehensive compendium of artists and writers confronting questions of Black identity, activism and social responsibility in the age of Malcolm X and the Black Panthers, based on the landmark traveling exhibition. What is 'Black art'? This question was posed and answered time and time again between 1960 and 1980 by artists, curators and critics deeply affected by this turbulent period of radical social and political upheaval in America. Rather than answering in one way, they argued for radically different ideas of what 'Black art' meant. Across newspapers and magazines, catalogs, pamphlets, interviews, public talks and panel discussions, a lively debate emerged between artists and others to address profound questions of how Black artists should or should not deal with politics, about what audiences they should address and inspire, where they should try to exhibit, how their work should be curated, and whether there was or was not such a category as 'Black art' in the first place. Conceived as a reader connected to the landmark exhibition Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power, which shone a light on the vital contributions made by Black artists over two decades, this anthology collects over 200 texts from the artists, critics, curators and others who sought to shape and define the art of their time. Exhaustively researched and edited by exhibition curator Mark Godfrey, who provides the substantial introduction, and Allie Biswas, included are rare and out-of-print texts from artists and writers, as well as texts published for the first time ever.\" -- Provided by publisher"
