## 1. How do economic periods (measured through GDP) influence art themes in America?

-   We wondered whether there was any correlation between the art themes present in a certain country and the economic well being of that country.

## 2. How do social movements affect art themes in America?

-   We chose this to get a broader perspective on what affects art themes in America and build on our findings from question 1.

#### We chose America because it is the hub of economic activity and therefore it might be interesting to see if there is strong correlation between popular art themes.
