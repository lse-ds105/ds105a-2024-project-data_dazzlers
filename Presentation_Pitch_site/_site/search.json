If there is a range of years, we will change the data to only contain the start year for ease of analysis. (This will also be done with the other two APIs)\n\n\n\n\nLook at the frequency of tags of a social movement and check whether this trends with the emergence of new art themes or the frequency of art themes being created. Chose this as it has social movement tags organised into subreddits so we can find information on social movements easily. Reddit is also older than Twitter so we can look at a more comprehensive data set. Needs an access key- create an application in Reddit’s developer portal. This process provides you with a client ID and a client secret, which are used to authenticate requests. Request limit: 60 per minute per user but can be expanded depending on usage and agreement with Reddit. We may need to design our system to stay within these limits or implement rate limiting to avoid getting temporarily blocked. Json format Endpoints: hot, new, top, and search endpoints for post data. Comment and user profile endpoints. User-generated content, including posts, comments, upvotes, and metadata. Highly unstructured text data. Data can be noisy. Data processing: Natural Language Processing (NLP)- For analysing themes, sentiment, and keyword extraction. It might have to be used depending on the volume of data we extract; Filtering: Removing irrelevant posts, spam, or non-English content.\n\n\n\nWe will scrape data of all American art from 1929 to 2023 to look at the themes of this art. We will use this for both the first and second question. Chose this because it has a lot of data on American art ( with 11 million artworks) and it clearly categorises its art into topics (aka themes) therefore allowing us to analyse this data. Requires an access key: obtain by registering through the api.data.gov portal​ , GitHub , Postman API Platform . There is no strict request limit for the Smithsonian API, but it encourages developers to use the service responsibly and avoid excessive requests that might disrupt its systems.  Json format Metadata about artifacts and artworks in the Smithsonian collection. Well organised and easy to query. Medium ease of use – rich but nuanced data. Endpoints: Object search (e.g., by keyword, themes, or artist).; Fetching metadata for specific objects.; Retrieving media (e.g., images, videos). Data processing: Extract and standardize themes, artists, and periods."

    "text": "Backup plan:\n\nFor Technical Issues Redundancy in APIs: Use alternate APIs if one fails: For economic data: World Bank API or OECD API. For art metadata: Europeana API or other open-access museum APIs. For social sentiment: Twitter API as an alternative to Reddit. Rate-Limiting Solutions: Implement request queuing and caching to stay within rate limits. Utilize API-provided bulk download options, like Smithsonian’s collections dump. Use time.sleep() to limit the requests Local Backup: Download and store datasets locally for continued analysis if APIs become inaccessible.\nFor Data Quality Issues Preprocessing Pipelines: Develop robust data cleaning processes: NLP models for Reddit (e.g., spam detection and topic modeling). Validation scripts for metadata completeness in Smithsonian datasets. Other Sources: Use academic and institutional reports or curated datasets for missing thematic data or validation.\nFor Analytical Risks Iterative Analysis: Use peer reviews to validate findings. Transparent Reporting: Clearly state assumptions, limitations, and potential biases in the project’s findings.\nFor Ethical and Legal Risks Compliance with Terms: Review and strictly adhere to API terms of service and usage policies. Data Privacy Safeguards: Anonymize Reddit user data and focus on aggregated insights."
